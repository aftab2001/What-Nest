            <p>
                After 10th results are out, there is one common question that strikes in every student’s mind “What next after 10th”? Science, Commerce or Arts? This is a common confusion which most of the students face. Every field has a lot of career opportunities but choosing the right stream which students are interested should be the main concern. 

Sachin Tendulkar failed in 10th. But he was very clear what he wanted from his life. 

But are we? Few students are very clear about what they want in their life. But there are many students who are confused about their career path. Class 10th is the most important and confusing crossroad of your career. A right decision can help you blossom in your career. And if you make the wrong choice, you will have to face the consequences for the rest of your life.

                Mistakes usually made while choosing the right career after 10th.
            </h1>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Following the crowd/friends</b> Most of the students chose a career option because their friends chose to do so.
                </li>
                <li><b> Parental/Societal pressure </b>Parents obviously want good for their children,so they suggest what they have seen was good at their period of time, outlooking their children's interest.</li>
                <li><b>Lack of knowledge</b> In past there were very few career options after 10th which didn't required to spend time and efforts to know about all career options, but the world now is outnumbered with options.</li>
